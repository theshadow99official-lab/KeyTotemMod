      # Step 1: Check out your repository's code.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Java Development Kit (JDK).
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # Step 3: THE FINAL FIX - Set up Gradle using a clean, official source.
      # This step completely bypasses your local gradlew script, solving the problem.
      - name: Setup Gradle
        uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3

      # Step 4: Run the Gradle build command.
      # Notice we are now just calling 'gradle' instead of './gradlew'.
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: gradle build --stacktrace
        
      # Step 5: Upload the compiled .jar file as a build artifact.
